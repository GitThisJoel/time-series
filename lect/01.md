# Lecture 1 

Start early! 

Look at the lecture videos, quite a few of them. Before 6 videos!

Group sizes: 1 or 2


## introduction

It is the confidence interval that is intresting.

How can we use data from related sources to predict something else, how do we know what data points to include?

## data

|--------|---|---|

model, validation and test data
~60%, ~20%, ~20%

1. randomly select test data
2. randomly select model part
3. build model, evalute on validation data, score 
4. back to 2.
5. evaluate the test data once!


1. build model using data 
2. examine the model residual, `y_t - \hat{y}_t = e_t`

## filter 

median filter is a good one.
